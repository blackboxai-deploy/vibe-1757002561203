# 2D Car Game Development Progress

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Project Structure & Types
- [x] Create TODO.md file
- [x] Create game types and interfaces (src/types/game.ts)
- [x] Create game utility functions (src/lib/gameUtils.ts)
- [x] Create core game logic (src/lib/gameLogic.ts)

### Phase 2: Game Components
- [x] Create main game canvas component (src/components/GameCanvas.tsx)
- [x] Create game UI overlay component (src/components/GameUI.tsx)
- [x] Create main car game component (src/components/CarGame.tsx)

### Phase 3: Main Application
- [x] Update main page component (src/app/page.tsx)
- [x] Create root layout component (src/app/layout.tsx)
- [x] Game-specific styles integrated via Tailwind CSS

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization
- [x] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) â†’ AI-generated images
  - No placeholder images detected in this project
  - Skipped automatically
- [x] Build application with --no-lint flag
- [x] Start development server
- [x] **FIXED**: Smart traffic generation ensuring safe escape routes
- [x] **ADDED**: Ambulance cars (ðŸš‘) with flashing lights and faster speed
- [x] **IMPROVED**: Game logic to prevent impossible situations
- [x] **MOBILE OPTIMIZED**: Portrait layout with touch controls
- [x] **CAPACITY**: 6 cars can fit in same lane with proper spacing
- [ ] Test game functionality (controls, collision, scoring)
- [ ] Test game states (start, gameplay, game over)
- [ ] Performance optimization and bug fixes

### Phase 5: Final Validation
- [ ] API testing with curl (if applicable)
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility check
- [ ] Final game testing and polish
- [ ] Documentation update

## Recent Mobile Optimizations:
âœ… **Portrait Layout**: 360x640px optimized for mobile screens (9:16 aspect ratio)
âœ… **Touch Controls**: Tap left/right sides to change lanes, center to pause
âœ… **Car Sizing**: Reduced car dimensions (45x80px) to fit 6 cars per lane
âœ… **Mobile UI**: Smaller, more compact game interface and controls
âœ… **Responsive Design**: Auto-scaling canvas with proper mobile styling
âœ… **Smart Spacing**: Algorithm ensures 6 cars can fit with proper spacing
âœ… **Enhanced Capacity**: Improved spawn logic for higher car density on longer screen

## Traffic Generation Fixes (Latest):
âœ… **Reduced Traffic Density**: Max 8 total cars on screen (was unlimited)
âœ… **Better Spacing**: 2x car lengths minimum spacing between cars
âœ… **Ambulance Balance**: Reduced to 8% spawn rate, only 10% faster (was 15% rate, 20% faster)
âœ… **Escape Route Guarantee**: Always ensures player has clear adjacent lane
âœ… **Smart Skip Logic**: Skips spawning when player would be trapped
âœ… **Gentler Progression**: Slower difficulty ramp and more conservative spawn rates
âœ… **Lane Capacity Limit**: Max 4 cars per lane (reduced from 6 for better gameplay)

## Previous Improvements:
âœ… **Smart Traffic Logic**: Cars spawn intelligently ensuring safe escape routes
âœ… **Ambulance Feature**: 15% chance for ðŸš‘ with flashing lights and 20% faster speed
âœ… **Escape Route Algorithm**: Always ensures at least one safe lane for player
âœ… **Visual Enhancements**: Ambulances with red cross, emergency lights, special styling

## Current Status: Mobile-Optimized Game Ready for Testing
Next: Test mobile touch controls and validate 6-car lane capacity
